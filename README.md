# StringParser

This is a program that parses a sentence and replaces each word with the following: First letter, number of distinct characters between first and last character, and last letter.  For example, Smooth would become S4h.  Words are separated by spaces or non-alphabetic characters and these separators should be maintained in their original form and location in the answer.
